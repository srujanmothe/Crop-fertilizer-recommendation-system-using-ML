- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  

### Data Processing & Analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive Python coding  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model implementation  
- **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values and duplicates  

### Machine Learning Algorithms

## Methodology  
### Data Collection  
- Gather historical agricultural data for crops and fertilizers.  
- Use Pandas (`pd.read_csv()`) to load datasets.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Understand dataset structure using `head()`, `tail()`, `shape()`, `describe()`, `info()`.  
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using Seaborn (`histplot()`, `heatmap()`) and Matplotlib (`plt.hist()`, `plt.scatter()`).  

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values and duplicates (`isnull().sum()`, `duplicated().sum()`).  
- Feature scaling and transformation using `train_test_split()` and `StandardScaler()`.  

### Model Building & Evaluation  
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `fit()`.  
- Evaluate model performance using `predict()` and `mean_absolute_error()`.  

## Problem Statement  
Agriculture is vital for food security, yet farmers struggle with selecting the right crops and fertilizers. Traditional decision-making is inefficient and unsustainable. This project aims to develop a **Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System** using machine learning to:  
- Recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and climatic factors.  
- Suggest optimal fertilizers to improve soil health and maximize yield.  
- Enhance farming efficiency through data-driven insights.  

## Solution  
- **Data Loading:** Load crop and fertilizer datasets.  
- **EDA:** Analyze dataset structure and statistics.  
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Selection:** Identify and preprocess relevant features.  
- **Model Training:** Train a Decision Tree Classifier.  
- **Prediction:** Recommend the best crop based on soil composition, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.  

## Visualizations & Model Outputs  
- **Histograms & Scatter Plots** – Data distributions  
- **Box Plots & Heatmaps** – Outlier detection and correlations  
- **Crop Dictionary & Feature Scaling** – Preprocessing steps  
- **Predictive Model Results** – Final recommendation outputs  

## Conclusion  
The **Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System** leverages machine learning to modernize agriculture. By providing precise recommendations, it helps farmers make data-driven decisions, improving productivity and sustainability. This approach reduces trial-and-error, optimizes soil health, and ensures efficient resource utilization.
