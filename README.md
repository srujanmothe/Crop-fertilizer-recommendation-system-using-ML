# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Crop Recommendation System that suggests the best crop to grow based on various environmental factors. The system utilizes a dataset containing soil composition, weather conditions, and other relevant attributes to make predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature distribution analysis
- Crop classification based on environmental conditions
- Machine learning model for recommendations (if applicable)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Crop_recommendation.csv`, which contains:
- **N, P, K:** Soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium)
- **Temperature & Humidity:** Climatic conditions
- **pH & Rainfall:** Soil acidity and rainfall levels
- **Label:** The recommended crop

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation.git
cd crop-recommendation
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook crop.ipynb
```

## Visualizations
The project includes:
- Histograms to analyze feature distributions
- Scatter plots for feature relationships
- Other insights into the dataset
